# Edge

Where a [`Connection`](/api-reference/types/connection) is the minimal description of an edge between
two nodes, an `Edge` is the complete description with everything React Flow needs
to know in order to render it.

```ts
export type Edge<T> = DefaultEdge<T> | SmoothStepEdge<T> | BezierEdge<T>;
```

## Variants

### DefaultEdge

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/v11/packages/core/src/types/edges.ts/#L17)

<PropsTable {...defaultEdgeFields} />

### SmoothStepEdge

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/v11/packages/core/src/types/edges.ts/#L49)

The `SmoothStepEdge` variant has all the same fields as the `DefaultEdge`
variant, but it also has the following additional fields:

<PropsTable {...smoothStepEdgeTypeFields} />

### BezierEdge

[Source on GitHub](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/v11/packages/core/src/types/edges.ts/#L58)

The `BezierEdge` variant has all the same fields as the `DefaultEdge` variant,
but it also has the following additional fields:

<PropsTable {...bezierEdgeTypeFields} />

## Default edge types

You can create any of React Flow's default edges by setting the `type` property
to one of the following values:

- `"default"`
- `"straight"`
- `"step"`
- `"smoothstep"`
- `"simplebezier"`

If you don't set the `type` property at all, React Flow will fallback to the
`"default"` bezier curve edge type.

These default edges are available even if you set the [`edgeTypes`](/api-reference/react-flow#edge-types)
prop to something else, unless you override any of these keys directly.
